    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Lorem Ipsam </h1>
<p>
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of <b>classical</b> Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney <mark>College in Virginia</mark>, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, <ins>from a Lorem Ipsum passage</ins>, and going through the <i>cites of the word</i> in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections <strong>1.10.32 and 1.10.33</strong> of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, <small>very popular during the Renaissance</small>. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, <em>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section</em> 1.10.32.
